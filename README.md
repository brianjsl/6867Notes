# 6867Notes
These are lecture notes from 6.867: Graduate Machine Learning, taught by Tommi Jaakkola, Suvrit Sra, and Pulkit Agrawal at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Fall 2021. The notes are still slightly incomplete, particularly the sections on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), generative models, and Reinforcement Learning.
